# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Naive-Bayes

Sentiment analysis in textual movie reviews
The project presents two approaches for the sentiment analysis. The first one builds the Naive Bayes from scratch. The second one uses existing libraries and achieved a 5-folds accuracy about 80%. Please note that this project was only made during lab sessions.
You can find the project description in the TPBayes_vEnglish.pdf file. The repository doesn't include the data of overviews that was used for now.
